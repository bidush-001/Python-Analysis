# Student Mental Health and Academic Success – Data Analytics Project

This project explores how mental health symptoms, academic pressure, and financial concerns relate to university students’ academic performance (CGPA). Using a real-world student survey dataset, I applied data cleaning, exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and clustering to uncover insights relevant to student support services.

## Objectives

- Understand how stress and well-being indicators affect GPA
- Identify patterns in student profiles using clustering
- Evaluate whether academic performance can be predicted from mental health data

## Tools and Techniques

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- Linear and Polynomial Regression
- K-Means Clustering
- Decision Tree Classification
- Data visualization and business-focused interpretation

## Key Findings

- Students with lower GPAs reported significantly higher depression symptoms, suggesting emotional well-being strongly correlates with academic struggles.
- Academic pressure was consistently high across all CGPA bands, not just among low performers, indicating a widespread issue.
- Clustering revealed distinct student segments, including a group at higher risk due to elevated stress and low support.
- The decision tree classification model achieved 44% accuracy. This suggests that mental health indicators alone are not sufficient for predicting academic outcomes, but they offer useful early warning signals.

## Recommendations

- Expand counseling and outreach for students with low academic performance
- Introduce university-wide workshops on stress management and healthy study habits
- Use student clustering to identify and support at-risk groups
- Combine mental health survey data with academic history for more reliable early-intervention systems
