# Python-Analysis
This project explores the relationship between student well-being, mental health, and academic success. The dataset, available on Kaggle, served as the foundation for a hands-on analysis that involved several key data preprocessing and modeling steps.

I cleaned the dataset, addressed missing values, and encoded categorical features to prepare the data for analysis. I applied both Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression techniques to model the data and make predictions. To evaluate model performance, I used metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared for regression tasks. For classification models, I relied on accuracy, F1 score, and AUC.

Throughout the project, I used Jupyter notebooks to document and visualize the results, capture the problem-solving process, and reflect on my development as an aspiring data analyst.
